## Opening Thoughts ##
> This project is to serve as a comprehensive full-stack application to exercise my expertise of web-development skills and knowledge, from initial project inception, wireframing, prototyping, testing, to fully realized product delivery. With this project, my goals are to adhere to the agile scrum development methodologies, focusing on MVP model of product development by setting timely deadlines and feature implementation, using web dev best practices. Through the use of the platform that I build, I will also be journaling my experiences, my successess and my roadblocks. The goal of this project is to practice the full breath and depth of the web dev experience.

## Heading ##

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A platform for hosting content for bloggers and users without needing to touch code.

## Summary ##
  > As a web developer, we often create static or semi static webpages that need to be edited or altered using code to make any changes to the content. Drawing inspiration from how blogs and product listing pages work, my goal is to create a content management system (CMS) where users can publish content without ever needing to write code. This is product looks to serve as a publishing platform for non-technical users. 

## Problem ##
  > Users need to have web developing experience to create content.

## Solution ##
  > By creating a CMS platform, users are able to create content without the need of coding themselves. The platform is provided by this product.
